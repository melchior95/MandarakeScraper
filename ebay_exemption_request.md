**Subject**: Request for Exemption from Marketplace Account Deletion Notification Requirement

**To**: eBay Developer Support

---

## Request Details

**Developer Account**: [Your eBay Developer Account Email]
**Application Name**: Mandarake Product Price Comparison Tool
**Application Type**: Product Data Scraper/Price Comparison Tool
**API Usage**: Browse API for sold listings analysis

## Exemption Request

I am writing to request an exemption from the Marketplace Account Deletion Notification endpoint requirement for my application. Based on eBay's documentation stating that developers who do not store user personal data may be eligible for exemptions, I believe my application qualifies.

## Application Description

My application is a **product price comparison tool** that:

1. **Scrapes product data** from Mandarake (Japanese collectibles marketplace)
2. **Searches eBay sold listings** using the Browse API to find comparable products
3. **Performs price analysis** to help users understand market values
4. **Generates reports** comparing prices between platforms

## Data Collection Scope

### ✅ Data We DO Collect:
- **Product Information**: Titles, descriptions, categories, SKUs
- **Pricing Data**: Current prices, sold prices, price history
- **Product Images**: Thumbnails and product photos for comparison
- **Marketplace Data**: Platform names, listing URLs, availability status
- **Business Seller Information**: Store names, seller ratings (public business data)

### ❌ Data We DO NOT Collect:
- **User Personal Information**: No buyer names, emails, addresses, or phone numbers
- **User Profiles**: No personal user accounts, preferences, or behavioral data
- **Payment Information**: No credit cards, PayPal accounts, or financial data
- **Private Communications**: No messages, reviews authored by users, or personal communications
- **Location Data**: No personal addresses or geolocation information
- **Device Information**: No personal device IDs, cookies, or tracking data

## Technical Implementation

The application operates as follows:

1. **Mandarake Data Collection**: Scrapes public product listings (no user accounts required)
2. **eBay API Usage**: Uses Browse API to search sold listings by product title/image
3. **Data Processing**: Compares prices and generates analytics reports
4. **Data Storage**: Only stores aggregated product and pricing data in local databases
5. **Output**: Exports comparison results to spreadsheets for business analysis

## Why Exemption is Appropriate

1. **No User Personal Data**: The application exclusively processes product and business data, not personal user information
2. **Public Data Only**: All collected data is already publicly available on marketplace websites
3. **B2B Use Case**: Used for business price analysis, not consumer profiling
4. **No User Accounts**: The application doesn't create or manage user accounts
5. **Compliance Focused**: Built specifically to avoid personal data collection

## Relevant eBay Documentation

According to eBay's Marketplace Account Deletion documentation:

> "Developers who don't store user data may be eligible for exemptions"

My application falls into this category as it processes only publicly available product and business data without collecting any personal user information.

## Alternative Compliance Measures

While requesting this exemption, I want to emphasize my commitment to data privacy:

1. **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary product data for price comparison
2. **No Personal Data Policy**: Explicitly designed to avoid personal information
3. **Regular Audits**: Periodic review of data collection to ensure compliance
4. **Documentation**: Maintain clear records of what data is collected and why
