# eBay Image Search for Sold Listings - User Guide

This implementation provides comprehensive image-based market analysis for finding sold listings on eBay. Upload an image of a product and get detailed pricing analysis, profit calculations, and market recommendations.

## üéØ Overview

The system offers three main approaches to image-based market research:

1. **Direct eBay Image Search** - Upload image directly to eBay's image search, then analyze sold listings
2. **Google Lens + eBay Search** - Use Google Lens to identify product names, then search eBay sold listings by text
3. **Hybrid Analysis** - Combine multiple methods for comprehensive results

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Using the GUI

1. Open the Mandarake Scraper GUI
2. Go to the **"eBay Analysis"** tab
3. In the **"Image Search"** section:
   - Click **"Select Image..."** to upload your product image
   - Choose your search method (Direct eBay or Google Lens)
   - Select image enhancement level (light/medium/aggressive)
   - **Enable "Lazy Search"** for intelligent keyword optimization
   - **Enable "AI Search Confirmation"** for automated result validation
   - Click **"Search by Image"** for single method or **"AI Smart Search"** for comprehensive analysis
4. Review results in the analysis table with profit calculations

### Command Line Usage

#### Quick Analysis (Direct eBay search)
```bash
python image_analysis_engine.py "path/to/product_image.jpg"
```

#### Thorough Analysis (Multiple methods)
```bash
python image_analysis_engine.py "path/to/product_image.jpg" --thorough --save-report
```

## üìä Understanding Results

### GUI Results Table
| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Item Title | Product name or search term used |
| Mandarake (¬•) | Estimated purchase price in Japanese Yen |
| Sold Count | Number of sold listings found |
| Median ($) | Median selling price in USD |
| Price Range ($) | Min-Max price range |
| Profit % | Estimated profit margin |
| Est. Profit ($) | Estimated profit in USD |

### Profit Calculation Formula
```
Net Proceeds = eBay Price - (eBay Fees + Shipping)
Profit Margin = ((Net Proceeds - Purchase Cost) / Purchase Cost) √ó 100
```

Where:
- eBay Fees = 13% (eBay + PayPal fees)
- Shipping = $5.00 (estimated)

## üéØ Best Practices

### Image Quality Tips
1. **Use high-resolution images** (but will be auto-resized)
2. **Ensure good lighting** and clear product visibility
3. **Include product packaging** when relevant
4. **Avoid cluttered backgrounds** when possible
5. **Show any text/labels** clearly

### Search Strategy
1. **Start with medium enhancement** for most images
2. **Try both search methods** for important items
3. **Use aggressive enhancement** for blurry/old photos
4. **Check multiple crop variants** for complex images

### Market Research Tips
1. **Require minimum 5 sold listings** for confidence
2. **Look for stable price ranges** (low variation)
3. **Consider seasonality** in your analysis
4. **Factor in item condition** differences
5. **Account for authentication costs** on high-value items

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "No sold listings found"
- Try different enhancement levels
- Use Google Lens method instead of direct search
- Check if item is too new/rare for sold data
- Verify image shows the product clearly

#### "Image analysis failed"
- Ensure image file is not corrupted
- Check internet connection for online searches
- Try with a smaller/simpler image
- Check if Playwright is properly installed

#### Poor search results
- Use aggressive enhancement for low-quality images
- Try cropping to focus on the main product
- Remove backgrounds that might confuse search
- Use multiple search methods for comparison

### Error Messages

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Please select an image file first" | Use "Select Image..." button to choose a file |
| "eBay API not configured" | Check eBay credentials in Advanced tab |

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies

Required Python packages (automatically installed):
- `playwright` - Web automation for eBay search
- `beautifulsoup4` - HTML parsing
- `pillow` - Image processing
- `opencv-python` - Advanced image enhancement
- `numpy` - Image array processing

## üìà Advanced Usage

### Batch Analysis
```python
from image_analysis_engine import ImageAnalysisEngine

engine = ImageAnalysisEngine({'usd_jpy_rate': 145})
images = ['image1.jpg', 'image2.jpg', 'image3.jpg']

for image_path in images:
    result = engine.analyze_image_comprehensive(image_path)
    summary = engine.get_analysis_summary(result)
    print(summary)
    engine.save_analysis_report(result)
```

### Custom Configuration
```python
config = {
    'usd_jpy_rate': 140,
    'min_profit_margin': 25,
    'ebay_fees_percent': 0.13,
    'shipping_cost': 7.0
}

engine = ImageAnalysisEngine(config)
result = engine.analyze_image_comprehensive('product.jpg')
```

## üß† Lazy Search Technology

### What is Lazy Search?
Lazy Search is an intelligent search optimization system that improves eBay matching by:

1. **Keyword Extraction**: Identifies the most important terms from product descriptions
2. **Text Simplification**: Removes unnecessary words that might confuse search algorithms
3. **Romanization Variants**: Handles different spellings of Japanese names (e.g., "Yura Kano" vs "Yuraka no")
4. **Progressive Search Strategy**: Tries multiple search term combinations, from specific to general
5. **Automatic Fallback**: Switches to optimized text search if image search yields poor results

### When Lazy Search Activates
- **Poor Image Results**: When direct image search finds fewer than 3 sold items
- **Google Lens Mode**: Automatically optimizes identified product names
- **AI Smart Search**: Uses lazy search for all methods to ensure comprehensive coverage

### Search Term Optimization Examples
| Original Term | Lazy Search Variations |
|---------------|----------------------|
| "Yura Kano Photo Book Collection Majikano Japanese Gravure Model" | "Yura Kano", "photo book", "Yura Kano photo", "gravure model" |
| "Premium Nude POSE BOOK Act Yura Kano Posing Art Book Photo Japan JAV" | "Yura Kano", "pose book", "art book", "japan photo" |
| "Visual Nude Pose Book act Yura Kano How to Draw Posing Art Japan Import" | "Yura Kano", "pose book", "visual nude", "art japan" |
