- `alert_storage.py` - Persistence only
- `alert_manager.py` - Business logic only
- `alert_tab.py` - UI only

### Type Safety
- Type hints throughout
- Enum-based state management
- Validation on state transitions

### Documentation

- Usage examples
- Integration guide

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Possible Additions
1. **Email Notifications** - Alert when items meet thresholds
2. **Export to CSV** - Export alerts for external tracking
3. **Notes Field** - Add notes to individual alerts
4. **Purchase Date Tracking** - Record when items were actually purchased
5. **Profit Calculation** - Calculate actual profit after sale
6. **Analytics Dashboard** - Show stats (total profit, success rate, etc.)
7. **Custom States** - Allow users to add custom workflow states
8. **Duplicate Detection** - Warn when adding similar alerts

## Architecture Benefits

### Why Modular?
- **Easy to maintain** - Each file has one job
- **Easy to test** - Mock dependencies easily
- **Easy to extend** - Add features without touching core
- **Easy to understand** - Clear separation of concerns

### Why Enums?
- **Type safety** - Catch invalid states at development time
- **Consistency** - Can't typo state names
- **Validation** - Built-in state transition checking

### Why JSON Storage?
- **Human-readable** - Easy to inspect/debug
- **Version control friendly** - Can diff changes
- **No dependencies** - Python built-in
- **Easy migration** - Can switch to DB later
