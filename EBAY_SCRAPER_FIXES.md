# eBay Scraper Fixes

## Issue: 0 Results Returned

The eBay Scrapy scraper was returning 0 results due to two main issues:

### 1. Bot Detection Challenge Page

eBay was serving a "Checking your browser before you access eBay" challenge page instead of actual search results.

**Solution:** Configure ScrapeOps proxy settings correctly in `settings.py`:

```python
SCRAPEOPS_PROXY_SETTINGS = {
    'country': 'us',
    'render_js': True,        # Use headless browser for JS rendering
    'bypass': 'generic_level_2',  # Enable bot detection bypass
}
```

**Important:** Parameters must be inside `SCRAPEOPS_PROXY_SETTINGS` dictionary, not as separate settings like `SCRAPEOPS_RENDER_JS = True`.

### 2. HTML Structure Change

eBay changed their search results HTML structure from `.s-item` to `.s-card` classes.

**Solution:** Updated selectors in `ebay_search.py` with fallbacks:

- **Container:** `.s-card` (was `.s-item`)
- **Title:** `.s-card__title` (was `.s-item__title`)
- **Price:** `.s-card__price` (was `.s-item__price`)
- **Image:** `.s-card__image` (was `.s-item__image`)
- **Seller:** `.s-card__subtitle` (was `.s-item__seller-info-text`)

All selectors include fallbacks to old `.s-item__*` classes in case eBay reverts or uses mixed formats.

## Files Modified

- `ebay-scrapy-scraper-main/ebay_scraper/settings.py:25-29`
- `ebay-scrapy-scraper-main/ebay_scraper/spiders/ebay_search.py:139-157` (container selectors)
- `ebay-scrapy-scraper-main/ebay_scraper/spiders/ebay_search.py:199-215` (title/URL extraction)
- `ebay-scrapy-scraper-main/ebay_scraper/spiders/ebay_search.py:243-252` (price extraction)
- `ebay-scrapy-scraper-main/ebay_scraper/spiders/ebay_search.py:296-303` (seller extraction)
- `ebay-scrapy-scraper-main/ebay_scraper/spiders/ebay_search.py:321-332` (image extraction)

## Key Learnings

- ScrapeOps proxy SDK requires parameters in `SCRAPEOPS_PROXY_SETTINGS` dict
- `render_js: True` uses headless browsers from underlying proxy providers (consumes 10 API credits per request)
- eBay frequently updates their HTML structure - always use fallback selectors
- Bot detection challenge pages return HTTP 200 but contain no actual data
