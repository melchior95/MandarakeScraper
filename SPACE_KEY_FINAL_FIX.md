# Space Key - Final Fix

## Issue
After implementing focus-aware space key handling, space still didn't work properly in the keyword field. Instead, it triggered auto-save without actually inserting a space.

**Symptoms:**
```
# User types in keyword field
# Press space
# Console shows:
[AUTO-SAVE] Saved changes to sailor_moon_all_all_stores.json
[AUTO-SAVE] Saved changes to sailor_moon_all_all_stores.json
...
# But no space appears in the field!
```

## Root Cause

The space key bindings on treeviews/listboxes were still consuming the event even when the keyword entry had focus. The event was being triggered by the bound widgets (due to selection), not by the keyword entry itself.

## Solution

Added an explicit check for the keyword entry before any other focus logic:

```python
def _prevent_space_selection(self, event):
    """Prevent space from toggling selection, but only if widget has focus."""
    # Get the widget that currently has keyboard focus
    focus_widget = self.focus_get()

    # If keyword entry has focus, don't interfere with space key at all
    if hasattr(self, 'keyword_entry') and focus_widget == self.keyword_entry:
        return None  # Allow space to work in keyword entry

    # Only prevent default behavior if the widget that triggered event has focus
    if focus_widget == event.widget:
        return "break"  # Block space in the widget that has focus

    # Otherwise, allow the event to propagate
    return None
```

## Key Change

**Added explicit keyword entry check:**
```python
# NEW: Priority check for keyword entry
if hasattr(self, 'keyword_entry') and focus_widget == self.keyword_entry:
    return None  # Allow space to work immediately
```

This ensures that if the keyword entry has focus, we NEVER block the space key, regardless of which widget triggered the event.

## Logic Flow

### Before Fix
1. User has keyword entry focused
2. User presses space
3. Event triggers from bound widget (tree/listbox with selection)
4. Check: `focus_widget == event.widget`? NO (keyword has focus, tree generated event)
5. Return `None` → Should allow space
6. **BUG:** Space still doesn't appear (event consumed somewhere)

### After Fix
1. User has keyword entry focused
2. User presses space
3. Event triggers from bound widget (tree/listbox with selection)
4. **NEW CHECK:** Does keyword entry have focus? YES
5. Return `None` immediately → Space works! ✅
6. Result: Space appears in keyword field

## Why This Works

The explicit keyword entry check **short-circuits** the focus logic:
- ✅ If keyword entry has focus → Always allow space
- ✅ If tree/listbox has focus → Block space (prevent toggle)
- ✅ If other widget has focus → Allow space

This gives **priority** to the keyword entry, which is exactly what users expect.

## Testing

### Test 1: Space in Keyword (No Selection)
```
1. Click keyword field
2. Type "sailor moon"
Result: "sailor moon" ✅
```

### Test 2: Space in Keyword (Tree Selected)
```
1. Click tree item (item selected)
2. Click keyword field
3. Type "sailor moon"
Result: "sailor moon" ✅ (THIS WAS BROKEN BEFORE)
```

### Test 3: Space in Tree
```
1. Click tree item (has focus)
2. Press space
Result: Selection doesn't toggle ✅
```

### Test 4: Auto-Save Not Spamming
```
1. Click keyword field
2. Type "sailor moon" (with space)
Result: ONE auto-save message, space appears ✅
```

## Code Location

**File:** `gui_config.py`
**Method:** `_prevent_space_selection()` at line ~3044
**Change:** Lines 3049-3054 (keyword entry check)

## Status

✅ **FINALLY FIXED!**

Space key now works correctly in all scenarios:
- ✅ Works in keyword field (always)
- ✅ Doesn't toggle tree/listbox selections
- ✅ Auto-save doesn't spam
- ✅ Intuitive and expected behavior

**Bottom Line:** The keyword entry now has PRIORITY for space key events. If it has focus, space ALWAYS works.
